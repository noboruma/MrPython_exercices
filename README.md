# MrPython_exercices
This repository contains python exercices and solutions coded from the IDE MrPython. The language used is a derivative from the original Python language.

## MrPyton IDE
MrPython is a minimalist Python source code editor with a primarily educational purpose.

## Main functions
- Python source code editing with assisted indentation and syntax highlighting
- Student mode with typing (PEP-484 annotations) and many other checks, functional graphics library, test assertions, etc.
- Expert mode with full Python language support

## Install MacOS
1) install python: [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or [python 3.8.6 installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-macosx10.9.pkg)
2) get [MrPython sources](https://github.com/nohtyprm/MrPython/archive/master.zip)
3) extract the archive to a directory of your choice, this will create a `MrPython-master/`directory with the software sources.
4) You can launch MrPython by double-clicking, in the `MrPython-master/mrpython/` subdirectory, on the `Application.py` file. You can also use the Python Launcher software installed with the Python environment on Mac, by consulting the [associated documentation](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/using/mac.html).

## Install Linux (Ubuntu and others)
1) install python: 
>apt-get install python3.8 python3-tk 
>sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3-tk

2) get [MrPython sources](https://github.com/nohtyprm/MrPython/archive/master.zip)

4) In the terminal, you can go to the `MrPython-master/mrpython` subdirectory of the project:
>cd MrPython-master/mrpython
>python3 ./Application.py

**Extra:** you can create alias or shortcut (replace \<MrPython path\> with the installation path used)
>alias mrpython="python3.8 \<MrPython path\>/MrPython-master/mrpython/Application.py"
